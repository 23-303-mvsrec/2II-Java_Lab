# 2II Java Lab

Welcome to my Java Lab repository! I am a student, and I post all my lab programs here.

## About This Repository

This repository contains all the lab programs that I have worked on as part of my coursework. The programs are primarily written in Java, with some additional programs in C. The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and share my work with others.

## Repository Structure

- `Java/`: Contains all the Java programs.
- `C/`: Contains all the C programs.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository and its contents.

## How to Use

To run any of the programs, navigate to the respective directory and compile the source code using the appropriate compiler. Here are the steps to compile and run the programs:
