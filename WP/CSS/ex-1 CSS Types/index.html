<h3>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol):</h3>
<p>is the communication protocol used to transfer data over the web.<n style="background-color: yellow;"> It follows a client-server architecture where browsers send requests and servers provide responses.</n> Common request methods include GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. By default, it works on port 80, while the secure version HTTPS works on port 443. Since it is stateless, each request is independent of the previous one.</p>
<h3>HTML (HyperText Markup Language):</h3>
<p>is the standard language used<n style="background-color: yellow;"> to create web pages.</n> It defines the structure of content using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. HTML uses tags like h1, p, and a to display and organize information. It acts as the skeleton of a webpage, while CSS and JavaScript enhance its design and functionality.</p>
<h3>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</h3>
<p>is used to style and format HTML documents.<n style="background-color: yellow;"> It controls how elements appear by setting layouts, colors, fonts, margins, and spacing.</n> CSS can be applied inline, internally within a page, or externally through a separate file. It also supports responsive design, making websites adaptable to different screen sizes. By separating content from presentation, CSS improves both flexibility and maintainability.</p>
<h3>JavaScript:</h3>
<p>is a widely used scripting language that brings<n style="background-color: yellow;"> interactivity to web pages.</n> It runs in web browsers on the client side and can dynamically manipulate HTML and CSS. JavaScript enables features such as form validation, animations, and event handling. It is also the foundation of modern web development, with popular frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Node.js extending its capabilities.</p>
<h3>Servlets:</h3>
<p>are Java programs that run on a server to handle client requests and generate responses. They are part of Java EE and are commonly<n style="background-color: yellow;"> used to build dynamic web applications.</n> Servlets can process form data, interact with databases, and deliver dynamic content to users. They run inside a servlet container such as Apache Tomcat. Servlets also form the basis for advanced Java web technologies like JSP and Spring MVC.</p>
